# Architecture Decision Records

This log records significant architectural and technical decisions for the Kubernetes Reliability Platform.

## ADR-001 — Use Local Kubernetes for the Core Project

**Date:** 2026-08-17

**Decision:**
The core project will run locally using kind for Kubernetes clusters.

**Reason:**
The project should not depend on AWS or other cloud providers for learning Kubernetes and SRE concepts. Local development reduces cost, complexity, and external dependencies while providing full Kubernetes functionality.

**Status:** Accepted

---

## ADR-002 — Use Python/FastAPI for the Application Layer

**Date:** 2026-08-17

**Decision:**
The microservices will be implemented using Python and FastAPI.

**Reason:**
The project focuses on Cloud/DevOps/SRE rather than Java-specific backend development. Python provides a natural foundation for the later AI layer and has excellent ecosystem support for FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, and observability tooling.

**Status:** Accepted

## ADR-003 — Use uv for Python Dependency Management

**Date:** 2026-08-17

**Decision:**
Python dependency and environment management will use `uv`.

**Reason:**
`uv` provides a modern, fast, and simple approach to Python project and dependency management, replacing the need for pip, pip-tools, and virtualenv separately.

**Status:** Accepted

---

## ADR-004 — Use PostgreSQL as the Database

**Date:** 2026-08-17

**Decision:**
PostgreSQL will be the database for all microservices.

**Reason:**
PostgreSQL is widely used, well-supported, runs locally in containers, and integrates naturally with SQLAlchemy. It provides realistic operational scenarios for database monitoring and failure simulation.

**Status:** Accepted

## ADR-005 — AI as the Final Layer

**Date:** 2026-08-17

**Decision:**
AI capabilities (incident analysis, tool calling, RAG, remediation) will be introduced only after the reliability platform works fully without AI.

**Reason:**
The platform must demonstrate operational engineering fundamentals independently. AI should augment existing observability and runbooks, not replace them. This ensures the reliability foundation is solid before adding AI complexity.

**Status:** Accepted

---

## ADR-006 — Intentionally Simple Business Logic

**Date:** 2026-08-17

**Decision:**
Application business logic will remain intentionally simple across all microservices.

**Reason:**
The primary purpose is demonstrating operational and reliability engineering concepts — not building a complex business application. Simple logic keeps focus on infrastructure, observability, and SRE practices.

**Status:** Accepted
